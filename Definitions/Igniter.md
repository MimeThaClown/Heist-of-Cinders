A relatively new invention, an igniter is a spell casting tool used for many broad purposes. While some igniters are designed for one purpose (such as removing grime and dirt from one's body/object), others are designed to universally wield magic, at the price of much greater expense. An igniter is made when placing a magic gemstone into an object. Popular universal igniters are staves,crystal balls, necklaces, and more!
