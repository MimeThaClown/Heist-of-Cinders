Lavendus serves as a town, academia, and faction in pursuit of higher knowledge. These scholars take on a diverse range of occupations and fields of study(alchemists, engineers, scribes, etc.). Bound by their infinite pursuit of knowledge and lore, many scholars become teachers at the academy to pass on their knowledge and possibly earn further insight on their pursuits. Many famed scholars and mages have graduated from Lavendus, such as Finn Brymstone, and Constance of the Thieves Guild. While Lavendus harbors no ill intent, there have been a few names that have gone in history for the misdeeds. Still, Lavendus takes every failure as a learning experience to better themselves, and the people of Aurivale. The scholars have built several libraries all across Sumeria, and have been granted to build a library in Fairchronia for the first time.
