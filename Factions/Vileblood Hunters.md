> "Greater Purpose? I'm afraid you must be mistaken. A hunter must hunt. That is our only truth." *- Father Lucien, The First Hunter*

Not long ago, Aurivale was completely untraversable. Territorial monsters and creatures seeped out from the [[Abyss]], and began to dominate the land. That was until the Vileblood Hunters appeared. The Hunters take on many tasks, but are notably known to slay monstrosities that roam the lands. Vampires, Werewolves, Vileblooded Beasts, and even Dragons are within their scope. While there may be few of them, they managed to gain a reputation for their efficient work. While no one knows who exactly leads the Vileblood Hunters, nor do they know where they originated, the two kingdoms are thankful for their protection and aid. Despite their scarcity, the hunters have earned themselves a reputation that is comparable enough to the Tribunal's Templar Knights. Some say that their efficiency and effectiveness is unparalleled. Yet, amidst their commendable deeds, whispers persist of the Huntersâ€™ secretive methods, shrouded in mystery and veiled in secrecy, as though they harbor something sinister within their actions.
