> "...it was then that the Sun Father gathered the warmth from **His** breast and entrusted the world with life shaped in **His** own image." - *Passages of Sol, pg.1*

When the [[Beloved Flame]] bursted into being, soon came the warmth that nurtured life into existence. The [[Tribes]] cultivated their lands, and kingdoms began to rise. Yet none would be possible without Flame and Sun that bring prosperity and shield them from the [[Forever Winters]]. Under that sentiment, the first faithful gathered, guided by divine revelation. United by devotion, the Tribunal was formed. The Tribunal is a sacred order devoted to the worship of[[Paracelsus| Paracelsus, the Sun Father]]. Though the Tribunal claims no land for its own, its influence shapes the courses of many empires and kingdoms with their divine authority. It is both church and sovereign arbiter; instrumenting the will of the [[Paracelsus|Sun Father]] through sacred scripture. To deny the Tribunal is to deny the warmth and compassion of life. A grave blasphemy that very few have committed, and fewer have gone without divine retribution. 

> "As the sun embraces life every morning without hesitation, so too should every man and woman approach a day—never promised—with gratitude. A heart devoted to **His** light finds not only purpose, but the fullness of life itself." - *Saint Aurorès, Former head-priest of the Tribunal*


The Tribunal's clergy primarily consists of priests, judicial friars, and templar knights. The Tribunal operates through its devoted clergy, each branch entrusted with their own sacred duties. Priests illuminate the faithful through teachings and prayers, guiding the people toward enlightenment. Judicial friars uphold the sacred law, ensuring that justice is served in accordance with divine will. Templars, sworn as both shield and sword, safeguard the people and the blessed lands they inhabit. 

The teachings of [[Paracelsus]] is often summed as the highest privilege amongst the Tribunal. The sacred calling for every priest or cleric is a road of commitment, sacrifice, and devotion. Worship of the Sun Father can occur any day, but large services are held every [[Welcome to Ashendel#Calendar|midden]]. Midden, the midpoint of the week, symbolizes the **eternal constancy of His flame**—neither rising nor fading, but burning with steadfast brilliance. It serves as a reminder that the Sun Father's light never wanes, guiding the faithful through all trials with unwavering warmth and wisdom.

Justice within the Tribunal is carried out through court. A judicial body that rules on matters both sacred and secular. It is said that the truth illuminated beneath the light of [[Paracelsus]] shall be granted divine finality. Prestige has no value in these courts. King and commoner alike must answer **His** scriptures as equals—souls bereft of wealth, lineage, or title. Their sentences are measured by the weight of their deeds rather than mortal standing. The Tribunal Court does not busy itself with normal disputes and grievances that bend to mortal ambition. Only actions that threaten the benediction of the [[Paracelsus|Sun Father]] and weigh against the light of creation assume their attention.

Preservation often demands an unwavering sword and shield, and none bear this duty more resolutely than the Templar knights. Entrusted with one of the Tribunal’s highest honors, they serve as the sworn protectors of the [[Fire Keepers |Keepers of Flame]]. This duty is only one of many for the knights. Guardians of light, they share the purpose of safeguarding holy sites, protecting the faithful, and rooting out blasphemy wherever it takes hold. Clad in consecrated steel and bearing the sigil of sun and flame, every strike is guided by their unconquerable spirit. Yet a Templar's journey never aligns with conquest or dominance. To bear the mantle of a Templar means to embody discipline, faith, and unshakeable resolve. A templar knight never wavers or hesitates before heresy, for they are the Sun Father's shield as much as they are **His** sword.
