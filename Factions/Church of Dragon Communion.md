> "The sublime beauty and inspiration of awe the dragons exude show that they are beyond radiance. Beyond the gods' hubris when they trespassed into their world. May Elphana Valkanna have mercy on their blasphemy." *- Mystmeralda, founder of the Church of Dragon Communion*

The Church of Dragon Communion is a church dedicated to the worship of Dragons. Exiled by both kingdoms, the church must act in secrecy. Their unwavering faith in dragons has profoundly shaped the course of the [[Dracarian War]], often tipping the scales through subterfuge and deception. Conniving and relentless, the church has infiltrated the ranks of high authority, planting spies in royal courts, military commands, and arcane institutions. Their motives remain shrouded in mystery—some believe they seek the return of an ancient dragon ruler, while others fear they intend to bring about an age where mortals kneel before dragonkind.

What first ignited their worship is unknown, but the Church of Dragon Communion has grown into a force that strikes fear across Aurivale. To some, they are zealots clinging to forgotten legends. To others, they are harbingers of a new era—one where dragons reign once more.
