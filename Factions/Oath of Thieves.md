> "For what greater honour is there, than the one among thieves?" *- Constance, Leader of the Oath of Thieves*

The Oath of Thieves faction is by far the most infamous and largest thieves guild in Aurivale. While its members prefer to call themselves "mercenaries," their operations revolve primarily around larceny, smuggling, and high-profile heists. Their success rates and grand heists contribute to their fame stretching all over the lands.

Sumeria has placed countless bounties on the guild for the heist of their King’s Crown. Oathtakers are not just mere pickpockets. Having access to sorcery and high level illusion magic has made their operations nearly impossible to track. Their frequent activity in Sumeria has led many to believe their base of operations lies within the kingdom’s walls.

However, whispers of **Oathtaker** movements in [[Fairchronia]] suggest their influence is expanding, and with it, the scope of their goals.
