The **Greater Partisans** are a renowned and powerful weapons dealing guild, revered across the lands for their unmatched craftsmanship and the vast influence they wield in the realm’s military affairs. Known for producing some of the most sought-after weaponry in the world, their reputation is as solid as the steel they forge. The guild’s prominence soared during the [[Dracarian War]], where their weapons played a pivotal role in the conflict, turning the tide of battle and earning them the admiration of all kingdoms alike. However, their "finer" steel comes at an extraordinary cost, often beyond the reach of most kingdoms and military forces. Only the wealthiest kingdoms and militia can afford to arm their armies with the iconic blades and armaments crafted by the **Greater Partisans**, making these weapons a symbol of status and power.

Founded by the veteran war-hero **Mint A. Arma**, the guild’s motives are deeply intertwined with Arma’s own convictions. At its core, the **Greater Partisans** are driven by a belief in strength and honor, valuing the balance between craftsmanship and warfare. However, their immense power and influence have not gone unnoticed. Many view the guild as a necessary evil, a stabilizing force in times of war but a dangerous political player in times of peace. Some believe the guild is slowly plotting to become the supreme ruler of the known world, using their weapons, agents, and wealth to control the fate of kingdoms. Others see them as the last hope in an increasingly unstable world, a force that can unite disparate regions under a single banner of strength.

The Greater Partisans are a large weapons manufacturing and dealing guild. Their name carries high prestige for having the world's finest weaponry and their large contributions to the [[Dracarian War]]. The Great Partisans was founded and currently lead by Mint A. Arma, a veteran war-hero who took a passion to blacksmithing in the midst of battle.
