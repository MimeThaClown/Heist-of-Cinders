# Heist-of-Cinders

**Welcome to the Player Vault for Heist of Cinders. Listed Below are a few tips.**

- This Folder shall serve similar as a **"Wiki"** created by and for the Players.
- You should always make your notes outside of the player-vault first. When you are finished,  you may place them in this vault however you see fit.
- You can create however many folders and notes you like, just remember that your fellow players can see them.
- Please **DO NOT** intentionally edit the same document another player is working on at the same time, this may cause a commit error.
- Please only provide information that the **ENTIRE** party will know. While I (**Quinton**) will not review these notes often, if I see too much information shared I will contact you.P
