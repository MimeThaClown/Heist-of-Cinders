### Last Time on Heist of Cinders
The session began where the last left off — in the heart of a crumbling warehouse, with Ryme having returned to the fold. But before anyone could catch their breath, the world twisted. Reality trembled beneath a wave of suffocating, blistering heat — a heat so intense it felt as though their very blood began to boil. The pain was unbearable... until it wasn’t. The sensation passed, leaving in its wake not weakness — but strength. The party felt sharper. Faster. Something within them had changed.

With the warehouse behind them, the party escorted Amaryllis home, traversing the dark streets of the Morrigan District. But fate had other plans. In their path stood a knight of the Tribunal — Callisto — speaking with Amara, a Pendragon knight who had taken to vigilantism. Callisto warned her to cease her reckless crusade. But Amara refused. Her ward, Emeric, had been taken — and nothing would keep her from him.

Sensing aligned purpose, the party struck a bargain — hiring Amara to aid in their search for Emeric. Yet before long, Amaryllis had slipped away — found walking arm in arm with none other than Callisto himself, vanishing with him deeper into the city.

Suspicion mounting, the party trailed them into the Merlin District, to what appeared to be Amaryllis’ home. But before they could react, Callisto was upon them — his mere presence forcing some of them to their knees beneath the crushing weight of his aura. When they explained their intent, Callisto relented — and in a gesture both terrifying and oddly sincere, offered each of them his blessing through a handshake, a transfer of power. All accepted — save for Amara.

Seeking respite and counsel, the party gathered at _Fortune’s Bold_ — a forge tied to Amara’s past. There they met Theodore Cinders, a trusted friend of Amara’s, and later her brother, Arranis — whose arrival came with both protection and warning. He would not let Amara face what lies ahead alone.

Their search led them into the sewers beneath the Tribunal. Hours passed in darkness, guided only by faint chalk symbols — until the party stumbled upon a twisted aberration: a gazer from the Abyss. A creature that should not have been here.

And deeper still... in a blood-stained torture chamber, they found Emeric — broken, beaten, but alive. And standing over him — Father Callisto himself. The Head Priest of the Tribunal.

Disappointed in their intrusion, Callisto turned to leave — allowing his entourage to finish the party. But Amara would not allow it — steel clashing against divine authority. Forced to take them seriously, Callisto revealed his terrifying might — hurling psychic spheres, warping space itself, and even opening a rift to the Abyss to cut off their escape.

The battle turned grim. The threat of total annihilation was real.

And so — in an act of sacrifice — one of their own tackled Callisto into the rift, sealing it behind them.

Silence. Pain. And survival.

Shaken to their core — the party gathered themselves. This was not like any battle they had fought before. The stakes had changed. The world had changed. And they had caught a glimpse of just how high the ladder truly climbed.

In the aftermath, Ryme examined Emeric — finding something unnatural within him. Reaching into his chest, Ryme pulled forth a golden cube — its purpose and power unknown.

Whatever comes next... the world will not wait for them to be ready.

### *Second Brawl*
Shouts of alarm suddenly ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the taproom — a monster with warty green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and bloodshot eyes. As it bares its yellow teeth and howls, you can see that a half-dozen bat-like creatures are attached to its body, with three more circling above it like flies. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the barkeep. "Oh shit, Troll!"

COMBAT: 1 Troll, Nine Stirges




### The Gilded Syndicate Sewers
A putrid stream flows along this sewer tunnel, which leads in two directions. In one direction, you see a tiny symbol drawn on the wall in yellow chalk: a palm-sized circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating out from its circumference.


After an hour of following signs through the tunnels, you come to a three-way intersection where a ladder leads up into a stone shaft capped by a circular metal cover. One of the familiar chalk symbols is marked on a wall nearby, and floating near the symbol is a spherical, grapefruit-sized creature with a bulging central eye and four stumpy eyestalks. It bares its teeth at you.

### **Rescuing Emeric**

Rescuing Emeric invites audience with the Archambeau family later in the day. Simon and Adrien Archambeau 


Awaking Emeric allows him to speak with the party. Seeing Amara for the first time will bring him great happiness because he knows no one else there. If the party asks what happened to him, he'll explain to the party that he wanted to research the artifact known as the lumiere. His parents had recently imported it from someplace called Nevalon, but they were not able to find any information about it. Over the last few weeks he had been researching the Lumiere and found out that there was another researcher in town who might have some info about it. Heading into the Morrigan district, that was when he was jumped by the syndicate.
