Hello everyone! My name is Mime. I have been dming for five years, but I've only ran one other campaign online! For this campaign, I hope to create an immersive and dramatic experience while running a revised version of Waterdeep Dragon Heist Module to better fit my homebrew world **Ashendel**. My plan is design a campaign where everyone has the opportunity for immersive and fantastic roleplay and collaboration. This campaign will be running from levels 1-13! My homebrew world fits in elements of my creation with moderate inspiration from Dark Souls.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the lands of **Aurivale**, a world once cursed with permanent frost and winter. That all changed when the god Paracelsus traversed through the celestial barrier and gifted the Beloved Flame, entrusting the world with the warmth of life. This moment marked the dawn of the **Age of Concord**, an era where gods greeted the mortals, and the foundations of civilization were set. At the heart of this newfound age rose the first faithful: The Tribunal. A powerful theocratic institution devoted to the worship of the Sun Father and the preservation of his eternal flame. 

Yet, even as warmth spread across the land, the forever winters beyond the habitable world remained untouched, home to the monstrous and merciless dragons. These primordial beings, acclimated to the ruthless frost, view the encroachment of fire as a hubris brought by the mortals. As the Tribunal seeks to maintain balance and order, the dragons gather in the frozen wastes, their wrath an ever-looming shadow over Aurivale, threatening to reclaim the world in ice and ruin. 

And yet, even with the constant dangers surrounding the lands, we find flourishing kingdoms, and a unwavering resolve for the people of Aurivale to strive. Diverse cultures, grandiose rulers, and ambitious adventurers carve their destinies—big or small—striving to shape the future. Some seek power, others seek knowledge, and many simply fight to survive in a world where dragons still reign. 

Our adventure begins on a seemingly small scale, following a select few who have yet to grasp the threads of fate that bind them together. Welcome to the kingdom of **Fairchronia**.

Set in the grand city of **Pendragon**, a bastion of wealth, where goods of any kind can be purchased or sold. Being the most important and influential city in the kingdom of **Fairchronia**, many factions, cultures, and ambitions collide within its towering walls. From the opulent halls of gilded nobles to the shadowed alleys where whispers of forbidden deals echo, Pendragon is a city of opportunity and peril in equal measure. Within this city of fortune is where we find the intertwining destines who are about to unfold a story of great importance. Whatever path they may take can very well alter the fate of the entire world.
