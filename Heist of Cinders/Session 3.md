### Last Time on Heist of Cinders
Time is against our newly formed comrades as they travel through the shady and treacherous Morrigan district. With the aid of Merlin, the party decided to travel to a run down tavern by the name of the Skewered Dragon, in hopes that the missing boy known as Emeric would somehow still be there. Eyes stirred  around the unlikely group as they entered the tavern, but they were able to get the information they needed. With each new clue revealed to the party, it was become more apparent that there was far more nuance and underlying motives than they knew.

Traveling to the farthest parts of the district, our comrades reached a dead end. Mostly run down buildings, the party could only gleam on three particular locations that could possibly contain the place they were looking for. A rundown and abandoned tavern, a moldy and worn library, and a crumbling warehouse. Splitting up to speed up their investigation, Xarrus headed towards the tavern, Ryme trailed towards the library, and Godfrey the warehouse. While Xarrus found nothing more than a few coins to their pouch. Ryme encountered the rumoured Bella that Dana the fairy had been talking about. Impatient, arrogant, and in a rebellious phase, Bella didn't their back and forth between them and ryme easy as he tried bringing her along. Still, there was no evidence showing that the party was on the right track. At least, not until Godfrey approached the warehouse.

Seemingly abandoned on the outside, the inside contained weapons, crates, and corpses. The smell of blood filled the area. As the party entered the warehouse, they were ambushed. Five kenkus struck from behind the shadows, using whatever underhanded tactic they could to thwart our newly formed comrades. Still, the kenku were thwarted, leaving one alive so you could possibly gleam more information about where Emeric's whereabouts could be. In your search, you found another hostage, a woman by the name of Amaryllis wwho is a supposed scholar of lavendus. 

Unfortunately without much time to consider the warehouse was surrounded by Tribunal members and even Father Callisto himself made an appearance. Discovering Godfrey and Ryme, who had purposefully made their presence known. After discussion with Father Callisto, you learned that there was an attack where Godfrey's performance would have been. While there were no deaths thanks to the Tribunal's aid, there were some injured,  including Lady Alariel Silverthorn of the Ferror council. Before Callisto could say more, he had other matters that required his attention. A knight by the name of Amara seems to be stirring trouble elsewhere. Bestowing a dagger to Godfrey, Callisto departed, leaving the party to discuss amongst one another. 


With so much evidence and clues to unravel, who knows if the party will be able to find Emeric in time.

We begin, with the ringing of church bells. A new addition to Pendragon included with the Tribunal church. The bell's soft yet resonant ring signifies that it is midnight. 

It  is now the 5th of Solrise,  and I welcome you back to the warehouse where the party resides.

Everything is as it was, our comrades are talkign with one another, and Ryme heads back inside. As the rest of the party goes to greet your companion something happens.

### *Second Brawl*
Shouts of alarm suddenly ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the taproom — a monster with warty green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and bloodshot eyes. As it bares its yellow teeth and howls, you can see that a half-dozen bat-like creatures are attached to its body, with three more circling above it like flies. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the barkeep. "Oh shit, Troll!"

COMBAT: 1 Troll, Nine Stirges

### **Speaking with "Merrick"**
The rather young and short young man picks up his glasses from the floor. Slighty cracked, he adjusts them before he speaks. 
"T-Thanks"

"I don't suppose you're aligned with one another. But if I could ask for some help. I-I can pay, a lot actually."

His friend was taken, and while he's not sure where he went, he last saw them near the Morrigan District. 

## Blood in the Streets
As the characters leave the Pellinore district, you may have a few moments to officially aquaint with one another, as it's a rather large walk to the Morrigan district.


Then, when you begin to turn a corner, you find yourselves on a street that has been cordoned off by the Tribunal. Lying on the cobblestones are a half-dozen corpses, seemingly the victims of some terrible skirmish. Templar Knights have disarmed and arrested three blood-drenched humans and are in the midst of questioning witnesses. One of the officers sees you. “Get on,” she says. “Nothing to see here.”

Tall, densely packed tenements leave most of the neighborhood in shadow at ground level. Most of the streetlamps have had their glass smashed and their candles stolen, and the smells of salt air and piss linger as you pass by rows of run-down buildings.

Still, you seem to pass by a shop that stands out greatly from the others. It has a deep purple facade, and in its window hangs a stuffed serpent. Above the door hangs a sign whose elaborate letters spell out “Old Merlin's.”


## Old Merlin's

A cloud of lavender-scented purple smoke trails out of the shop’s door as you peer inside. Every wall is painted purple, and every dusty knickknack on the shelves is dyed a deep violet.
The shopkeeper is a small old perhaps wizened gnome wearing a blue knit cap, and a leather-lined suit. As he eyes you he sees "No relation to the snake on the window. I just can't reach it."

**Where the session left off**

## The Skewered Dragon
The Skewered Dragon looks like a ruin. Both of its front-facing windows are smashed, and a ship’s anchor is lodged in the roof. Through the windows, you can see a group of haggard patrons drinking from huge tankards.


they’re known to frequent a warehouse in deeper morrigan district. “Look for the snake symbol on the door,” says one of the tavern regulars.



## Deeper into the Morrigan District
Gloom envelops a narrow alley as dark as a dungeon — and as odorous as one, too. Nearly all the streetlamps have been smashed. The only light that pierces the darkness is a faint flickering from down the lane, like a distant candle.

 A warehouse is directly across the street from the lamp, which illuminates a black winged Dragon.
 
 Symbol of the Oath of Thieves.
 
## Entering the Thieves Hideout

### **Z1** Main Room
 You enter a ramshackle two-story hideout. Seemingly rundown, you still see crates of weapons, boots, black uniforms, and other gear fill the main room.
 
 Tables and chairs have been carelessly tossed across the floor. The corpses of a dozen men lie along the walls, their rapiers and daggers lying nearby. On the north side of the area, stairs rise to an open level above.
 
 #### **Hiding Kenku**
 There are four hidden Kenku in this room, when provoked, they will strike and attack the party members. Only trying to flee and escape once two of the members have gone down.
 
 
 When kenku speak, they mimic sounds and voices they have heard before. Under interrogation, they repeat the following phrases:

- In a deep voice with an orcish accent: “Constance sends her regards.”
- In a thin, nasally voice: “Tie up the pretty boy in the back room!” and “Follow the golden signs in the sewers.” (This remark refers to tunnels in the sewers that are marked with Gilded Syndicate’s symbol where they lead to the Gilded Syndicate hideout.)
- In a scratchy voice: “No time to loot the place. Just get him to the boss.”
- In a voice similar to the young man. "It's just me you want right? Good then. Because I swear if you lay a hand on her-"
### Z2 Storage Closet
The door to this storage closet hangs loosely on broken hinges. The cramped chamber beyond smells strongly of sour fish and vinegar. It is filled with discarded ropes, canvas tarpaulins, and splintered wood from smashed barrels. Laying atop the rubble from a smashed barrel is an unconscious elven woman named Amaryllis, a scholar of Lavendus.

She was jumped by thugs while uh... just happened to be in the Morrigan District. She knows of someone else taken. Some rich boy,  who must be with the Gilded Syndicate.
### Z3 Secret Room
This room is hidden behind a secret door that can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. When the secret door is opened, the characters can hear the faint sound of a bell ringing in the offices above them ([area Z5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/adventures/wdh/a-friend-in-need#Z5Offices)).

The Zhents have stashed two wooden crates here. The first, stolen from the docks, contains four wood-framed paintings wrapped in leather. The paintings depict the cities of Luskan, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, and Baldur’s Gate and are worth 75 gp each.

The second crate, stolen from a caravan on the High Road, contains fifteen 10-pound silver trade bars, all black from corrosion but still worth 50 gp each.
### Z4 Balcony
The open second level is stacked with crates where it overlooks the main warehouse. Characters who search through the crates find all sorts of junk, including moth-eaten bolts of cloth, bottles of spoiled olive oil, and hundreds of pairs of wooden-soled sandals that were all the rage last summer but are now out of fashion. None of this junk is valuable.
### Z5 Offices
There is nothing to note in the offices up above.
Masque charm and Feather Token.
## The Templar Knights Arrive
Father Callisto and several other Templars arrive at the Oath of Thieves hideout. He explains what he knows about the gilded syndicate and where the party might find them.


## The Gilded Syndicate Sewers
A putrid stream flows along this sewer tunnel, which leads in two directions. In one direction, you see a tiny symbol drawn on the wall in yellow chalk: a palm-sized circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating out from its circumference.


After an hour of following signs through the tunnels, you come to a three-way intersection where a ladder leads up into a stone shaft capped by a circular metal cover. One of the familiar chalk symbols is marked on a wall nearby, and floating near the symbol is a spherical, grapefruit-sized creature with a bulging central eye and four stumpy eyestalks. It bares its teeth at you.
