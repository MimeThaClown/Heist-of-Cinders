## Opening
**Read the following excerpt to the players to introduce them to the campaign, and to the world of Ashendel**

It is the 276th year in the Age of Concord, an era where the gods and mortals alike walk in union, forging a new land cultivated beyond the age of dragons. Aurivale, the land of gold. A land born from the promise and dawning of concord, ignited by the Beloved Flame bestowed by the Magnficient Sun Father Paracelsus. It was only when the flame melted the merciless tundra that the beautiful continent revealed a diverse range of regions, mountain ranges, forests, deserts and other biomes. A new canvas of boundless opportunity for the tribes to cultivate and flourish.

I would like to welcome you to Fairchronia, a budding nation of promise, hope, and potential. No longer bound from the echoes of past involuntary allegience to Sumeria, The founding ruler Queen Drakon harmonizes her new Kingdom with ambitions of wealth and new beginnings. Under her rule the people are governed by an accord: "You will still live as you always have, The crown only asks for a small tithe of what you produce and what you earn, you follow it's laws, and bow to its leader. In return, as a denizen and founder of Fairchronia, you are promised the near certainty of a bright and promising future." In Southern Fairchronia is where we find the fair city of Pendragon. A port town, the only port town to be found in all of Aurivale. With the newly kindled Eternal Flame residing in Aria's Hearth. Pendragon boasts an astonishing size, first to claim territory that reaches nearly 20 kilometers deep into the Serrah Ocean. The governing rulers, known as the Ferror Council, safeguard the prosperity of their citizens while fostering a sense of security and hope. With the newly constructed Tribunal Church serving as a stronghold for the Templar knights, the city is now better protected than ever. Pendragon, while it may not be the capitol, it is most certaintly the heart of Fairchronia. Standing as the most influential city, and a beacon of power and progress.

Our Story begins in the central Escanor district of Pendragon. The scent of the ocean's saltwater mixes with the fragranted incenses placed on nearby shrines. The people have gathered before a raised platform placed in front of the Tribunal Church. Cloaks rustle as people whisper among themselves, merchants leave their stalls unattended, children play and weave through the crowd, laughter cutting through the low hum of voices, while armored Templar knights stand at the ready. The buzz of restless anticipation is almost palpable as nearly the entire city waits for something to happen. Soon, fanfare begins to silence the crowd, and important figures begin to take their place on the raised platform. Taking their seat in the center is a young woman adorned in a lovely forest green dress with floral patterns. Nearly on cue, the announcer speaks: "First, in service to Ferror Council, we welcome Lady Lysandra to the stands." Then the crowd roars in cheer and more fanfare explodes from instrumental horns. As the crowd dies down, Lady Lysandra walks up to stands and begins to speak. "People of Fairchronia. It is with my greatest pleasure that I be the one to announce that the Tribunal has finally arrived in Pendragon. With their, and the benevolent Sun Father's guidance, may we continue to walk the path of unity and virtue. Before I give Father Callisto the stand, I ask that we show him the utmost respect, dignity, and pride that I have seen everyday in our magnificent home. Father Callisto if you may." Soon,  a man with long blonde hair and a rather serious look stands from his seat and begins to walk to the center. "I must say, I already feel most welcomed within these city walls. Hospitality such as this is a rare treasure, and though I’ve never been one to favor lentil soup, the Roundtable has a way of making me crave another bowl. I've never been one for announcements so allow me to make this one short. So long as I stay in this city walls, I guarantee that I will do whatever in my power to keep this city safe. And if that is not enough reassurance, I have brought many promising upstarts including the rumored and famed Gem of the Tribunal. Later tonight, the esteemed Godfrey shall grace us with a performance at the Roundtable, where he will also accept any generous donations to aid in the swift establishment of our operations. Your support is invaluable, and for it, I thank you all.


With that, the gathering begins to break apart—some lingering to discuss the speech, others already making their way through the city’s winding streets. The air is alive with speculation, excitement, and the promise of an eventful night.

And so, as the sun begins its slow descent over Pendragon, the warm glow of lanterns beckons from the heart of the city—the famed Roundtable Tavern, where the real story is about to begin.







## Roundtable Tavern
 ### **Entrance**
 Inside the Roundtable Tavern, clinks of plates of tankards and plates battle against the soft melody of instrumentals. Worn, but sturdy wooden tables fill the center of the rather spacious tavern. The usual buzz of drunkards, gamblers, and chatter fill the room, as the only barkeep rushes from table to table. On the southern wall is what seems to be like a deep well, with a sign stating "ASK FIRST" in all capitols and with several exclamations.
 
 The laughter, and other noise pollution is quickly halted when Father Callisto steps into the tavern, alongside him is a woman with what seems to be leaves in her hair? *Chloe, would you like to describe your character*
 
 Sitting at a table already is a tall, and well-built man also adorning symbols and filigree of the Tribunal. While many have never had the pleasure of meeting him before, almost everyone has seen his face on the posters riddled all over Pendragon. *Skylar, would you like to describe your character?*

Sitting on the barstool is a young woman adorned in various jewelries and dresses to impress. While she makes idle conversation, her eyes can't help but wander to door anytime they swing open. *Mhia would you like to describe your character*
 
 Sitting in the corner with a more than modest-sized plate of various salted meats is a man taking in the sights. Observing every person that walks in, leaves, or anything else. Curiosity and a keen eye stirs within this figure. *Oli would you like to describe your character*
 
 Sitting in the opposite corner appears to be a man who prefers to do anything but stick out. Still, their curiosity gets the better of them as they observe in the sights and look all around them. *Aathi, would you like to describe your character*


### Tavern Brawl
As the chatter dies down, whispers, or more rather loud chattering can be heard at the table near the center.

"Lysandra was something else huh."

"Still did you see that woman? The one with the red hair, I could almost see the shine of her armor from the crowds? Very rich I reckon."

"Funny thing is, I know where she's staying. Probably won't be much to stir about while everyone's laughing at the tribunal's circus clown. How about then we- "

And before he could finish his sentence, a small thin line of pure concentrated cold trails to the underside of the one of the loud patrons. 

"Fuck. Who did that?", he begins to eye his surroundings, his eyes widen and he begins to walk over to this short black-haired young man, wearing a clean white shirt, suspenders, and glasses give away his rather nerdy appearance. 

"Well well, look what we got here. You're not supposed to be here"

### *Second Brawl*
Shouts of alarm suddenly ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the taproom — a monster with warty green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and bloodshot eyes. As it bares its yellow teeth and howls, you can see that a half-dozen bat-like creatures are attached to its body, with three more circling above it like flies. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the barkeep. "Oh shit, Troll!"

COMBAT: 1 Troll, Nine Stirges

### **Speaking with "Merrick"**
The rather young and short young man picks up his glasses from the floor. Slighty cracked, he adjusts them before he speaks. 
"T-Thanks"

"I don't suppose you're aligned with one another. But if I could ask for some help. I-I can pay, a lot actually."

His friend was taken, and while he's not sure where he went, he last saw them near the Morrigan District. 

## Blood in the Streets
As the characters leave the Pellinore district, you may have a few moments to officially aquaint with one another, as it's a rather large walk to the Morrigan district.


Then, when you begin to turn a corner, you find yourselves on a street that has been cordoned off by the Tribunal. Lying on the cobblestones are a half-dozen corpses, seemingly the victims of some terrible skirmish. Templar Knights have disarmed and arrested three blood-drenched humans and are in the midst of questioning witnesses. One of the officers sees you. “Get on,” she says. “Nothing to see here.”

Tall, densely packed tenements leave most of the neighborhood in shadow at ground level. Most of the streetlamps have had their glass smashed and their candles stolen, and the smells of salt air and piss linger as you pass by rows of run-down buildings.

Still, you seem to pass by a shop that stands out greatly from the others. It has a deep purple facade, and in its window hangs a stuffed serpent. Above the door hangs a sign whose elaborate letters spell out “Old Merlin's.”


## Old Merlin's

A cloud of lavender-scented purple smoke trails out of the shop’s door as you peer inside. Every wall is painted purple, and every dusty knickknack on the shelves is dyed a deep violet.
The shopkeeper is a small old perhaps wizened gnome wearing a blue knit cap, and a leather-lined suit. As he eyes you he sees "No relation to the snake on the window. I just can't reach it."

## The Skewered Dragon
The Skewered Dragon looks like a ruin. Both of its front-facing windows are smashed, and a ship’s anchor is lodged in the roof. Through the windows, you can see a group of haggard patrons drinking from huge tankards.

they’re known to frequent a warehouse in deeper morrigan district. “Look for the snake symbol on the door,” says one of the tavern regulars.


## Deeper into the Morrigan District
Gloom envelops a narrow alley as dark as a dungeon — and as odorous as one, too. Nearly all the streetlamps have been smashed. The only light that pierces the darkness is a faint flickering from down the lane, like a distant candle.

 A warehouse is directly across the street from the lamp, which illuminates a black winged Dragon.
 
 Symbol of the Oath of Thieves.
 
## Entering the Thieves Hideout

### **Z1** Main Room
 You enter a ramshackle two-story hideout. Seemingly rundown, you still see crates of weapons, boots, black uniforms, and other gear fill the main room.
 
 Tables and chairs have been carelessly tossed across the floor. The corpses of a dozen men lie along the walls, their rapiers and daggers lying nearby. On the north side of the area, stairs rise to an open level above.
 
 #### **Hiding Kenku**
 There are four hidden Kenku in this room, when provoked, they will strike and attack the party members. Only trying to flee and escape once two of the members have gone down.
 
 
 When kenku speak, they mimic sounds and voices they have heard before. Under interrogation, they repeat the following phrases:

- In a deep voice with an orcish accent: “Constance sends her regards.”
- In a thin, nasally voice: “Tie up the pretty boy in the back room!” and “Follow the golden signs in the sewers.” (This remark refers to tunnels in the sewers that are marked with Gilded Syndicate’s symbol where they lead to the Gilded Syndicate hideout.)
- In a scratchy voice: “No time to loot the place. Just get him to the boss.”
- In a voice similar to the young man. "It's just me you want right? Good then. Because I swear if you lay a hand on her-"
### Z2 Storage Closet
The door to this storage closet hangs loosely on broken hinges. The cramped chamber beyond smells strongly of sour fish and vinegar. It is filled with discarded ropes, canvas tarpaulins, and splintered wood from smashed barrels. Laying atop the rubble from a smashed barrel is an unconscious elven woman named Amaryllis, a scholar of Lavendus.

She was jumped by thugs while uh... just happened to be in the Morrigan District. She knows of someone else taken. Some rich boy,  who must be with the Gilded Syndicate.
### Z3 Secret Room
This room is hidden behind a secret door that can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. When the secret door is opened, the characters can hear the faint sound of a bell ringing in the offices above them ([area Z5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/adventures/wdh/a-friend-in-need#Z5Offices)).

The Zhents have stashed two wooden crates here. The first, stolen from the docks, contains four wood-framed paintings wrapped in leather. The paintings depict the cities of Luskan, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, and Baldur’s Gate and are worth 75 gp each.

The second crate, stolen from a caravan on the High Road, contains fifteen 10-pound silver trade bars, all black from corrosion but still worth 50 gp each.
### Z4 Balcony
The open second level is stacked with crates where it overlooks the main warehouse. Characters who search through the crates find all sorts of junk, including moth-eaten bolts of cloth, bottles of spoiled olive oil, and hundreds of pairs of wooden-soled sandals that were all the rage last summer but are now out of fashion. None of this junk is valuable.
### Z5 Offices
There is nothing to note in the offices up above.

## The Templar Knights Arrive
Father Callisto and several other Templars arrive at the Oath of Thieves hideout. He explains what he knows about the gilded syndicate and where the party might find them.


## The Gilded Syndicate Sewers
A putrid stream flows along this sewer tunnel, which leads in two directions. In one direction, you see a tiny symbol drawn on the wall in yellow chalk: a palm-sized circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating out from its circumference.


After an hour of following signs through the tunnels, you come to a three-way intersection where a ladder leads up into a stone shaft capped by a circular metal cover. One of the familiar chalk symbols is marked on a wall nearby, and floating near the symbol is a spherical, grapefruit-sized creature with a bulging central eye and four stumpy eyestalks. It bares its teeth at you.
