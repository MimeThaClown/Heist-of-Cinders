*Witch of Stars, The Silver Maiden, Goddess of the Stars*

Rhenna is the daughter of [[Paracelsus]] and [[Swoone]]. When the night sky is cloaked in darkness, Rhenna emerges as the beacon of light, casting her glow through the shadows and illuminating the heavens. She embodies the stars and the moon, radiating a serene yet potent presence. Rhenna is a gentle guide, offering solace and direction to those lost in the night. In moments when the Sun Father rests, she takes his place as the protector of all, watching over them with unwavering light in the uncertainty of the dark.

In her youth, she apprenticed under [[Dimalyse]], where she uncovered the mysteries of sorcery and the [[Weave]]. Through her studies, she discovered that the stars and the moon themselves held the essence of magic. With Dimalyse’s guidance, Rhenna wove the cosmos into her very being, mastering an arcane force unseen by mortals or gods. From her hands was born Graviturgy—the magic of gravity—an art that bends the weight of existence to her will, shaping the fabric of reality itself.

Rhenna feels most at home residing within the night sky. There, she can still embrace the night, but save time to spend with her parents. Worshippers of Rhenna laugh and chuckle by the aspect of Rhenna's homesickness.


### Depiction
