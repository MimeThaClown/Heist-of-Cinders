*Queen of Avarice, Goddess of Conquest*
Astarra is the daughter of [[Edros]] and [[Malkandra]]. She longs for conquest and domination over all things. Astarra wishes to twist all things to her will, even forcing the natural forces of nature or even flame to kneel before her whims. Being a goddess of war, Astarra's symbol is waved over the flags of conquerors, tyrants, and those who wish for complete and utter control.

Astarra has an ongoing rivalry with her husband [[Halmyros]]. They often place bets on champions and warriors and sees who comes out on top. This feud between the couple often gets out of hand, leading them to interfere with the strife of mortals, granting them godlike strength for advantage in battle. 

Followers of Astarra are often led by avarice and envy. Wanting to conquer the world under her name, regardless of the tactics needed.


### Depiction
Astarra is depicted as a shorter woman wearing a scornful expression adorned in dark armor and crimson hair. A claymore sits at her side and her open helmet reveals an eye of amber, and an eyepatch.
