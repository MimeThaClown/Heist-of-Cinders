*Lord of Strategy, The Wise, God of Contest*
Halmyros is the son of [[Auminoor]] and [[Boella]]. He represents the fairness and balance that life needs to continue to thrive. While he is declared as a war god, Halmyros believes in the battle of wits, rather than the clash of armaments. Halmyros believes that warriors of the mind can shape the future for the better, bringing peace through equality and fair competition.

Halmyros regretably has stirred a rivalry with his wife [[Astarra]]. While she believes in constant strife and domination, Halmyros wants nothing more than contest of fairness, respect, and honor. Still, he refuses to let his wife create creatures of avarice without their counterpart. He bestows his blessing and wisdom to those who'd rather take to wits and fairness, than strength and conquest. 

Followers of Halmyros are many, often waving his symbol to show honor and respect to their combatants.



### Depiction
