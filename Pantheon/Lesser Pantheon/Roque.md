*Death's Consort, The First Death, King of Liches*
Roque was created by unnatural means. Created from the clashing radiance of [[Swoone]] and [[Malkandra]], Roque was willed into being by the conviction by their "mother" Malkandra. Roque was designed to be the perfect consort for [[Enceladus]], the soon-to-be god of death, and the warden of souls. Roque only needed few words to understand their purpose, and to realize everything was going according to the Mother of Decay's plan.

Roque felt fascination towards Enceladus. While they couldn't quite call it love, they enjoyed spending time with their forever consort. As they traversed their new realm, Roque realized very quickly how dependable and adaptable Enceladus was. Even forced into this role, Enceladus fulfilled his new role and purpose with efficiency and with a hint of satisfaction. 

When Enceladus began to fill their realm with a sea of souls, Roque watched with envy, their consort had great responsibility, assuming the role of Reaper for all of Ashendel. Sensing this jealousy, Enceladus extended his hand, offering a portion of his responsibility to Roque, sharing the burden of soul warden. It was in this new purpose, Roque found new power. What purpose do souls have just swimming aimlessly in the river of [[Hel (Afterlife)|Hel]]? Channeling energy from his ancestry, and Enceladus, Roque began to channel the souls into recycled purpose. Their very first creation had risen before them: a mortal that was not quite living, and not quite dead. Roque had created necromancy.

Through their new pursuits, Roque had many several forms and varieties of undead. Zombies, Skeletons, and Hollow were just the beginning of their journey. Roque enjoyed their creations, but they weren't very powerful. Not nearly enough to their standards. That was when Roque found inspiration, and through their evolving mastery of necromancy Roque had made their very first lich. A being seperated from morality, and unmatched in necrotic energy. Satisfied with this creation, Roque unleashed their creations onto Aurivale, curious of whats to come. 

There are very few who know of Roque, and even fewer follow Roque in worship.
