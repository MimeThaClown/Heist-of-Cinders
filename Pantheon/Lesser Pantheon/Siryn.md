*Lady of Order, Goddess of Control*
Unlike most of the deities within the pantheon, Siryn was a mortal that had risen to godhood. While it is unclear how she was able to achieve such an extraordinary feat, the accomplishment still stands, and her power rivals many of her natural divine peers.

Siryn’s domain is one of absolute order and control. Obedience is not requested—it is demanded. Loyalty is not earned—it is enforced. Under her influence, choice is an illusion, as she exerts dominion over mind, body, and spirit alike. To follow Siryn is to surrender, to embrace the unyielding structure she weaves, where defiance is eradicated and unity is absolute. 

Siryn's activity ever since rising to godhood has been surprisingly minimal. Perhaps she's compiling her latest grand scheme.


### Depiction
Siryn is seen as a impossibly tall woman with blonde hair and unusuallly crystal blue eyes. Rumors state that there is a secret beyond her normal visage.

### Commandments
**Obey Siryn**: *What other purpose is there than pure, unconditional obedience?*
