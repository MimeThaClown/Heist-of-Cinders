*Princess of Miracles, The Second Twin, Goddess of Remedies*
Ephyra is one of the twins born from [[Swoone]] and [[Phiore]]. During their youth, she and her brother were nearly identical and were often mistaken for each other. Besides appearance however, they could not be any more different in regards to personality and motivation. Ephyra embodies the ever-flowing essence of healing, granting life-saving miracles and medicine to the world. Her presence was a balm to the weary. [[Ephyros]] however, liked to spread ailments and poison, often counteracting all the work and love Ephyra had spread. Though equal in birth, her twin was always stronger—possibly a dire consequence of her being conceived second. Ephyra felt like she always needed to catch up to her twin, overworking her fragile radiance just to maintain a semblance of balance with her counterpart. Yet still she perserveres, even in the face of unevitable defeat, it is the small victories where she triumphs and reveals the hope of her miracles.

Despite all the pain, Ephyra could never bring herself to hate Ephyros. While he may treat her differently than most siblings, she believes that he is simply misguided, lost from the enviornment he had been raised in. No, unlike the mortals and the other gods, she never saw Ephyros as a monster. Instead, she saw her lonely brother, slandered and abandoned by their parents disappointment. The void that rests within him, shaping his pleas for attention into horrible misdeeds.

And so, she endures. Much like those who worship her, she understands that path she takes will be riddled with thorns and failure. But she knows that like the mortals she adores, her brother will break, and shatter. And when that day comes—when the weight of his own destruction finally crushes him, when the sickness he has sown takes root within his own soul—she will not gloat, nor will she turn away. She will do what she has always done.

She will heal.

### Depiction
Ephyra is seen as a young woman with pale skin that nearly matches the long platinum blond hair that is wrapped neatly into a crown braid. Hiding her slender build, she adorns silver armor engraved with delicate filgree patterns that resemble mending and miracles. Besides the long hair and the beauty mark that rests just below her left cheek, she is remarkably similar to the depiction of her brother. Delicate features, with high cheekbones, and a slightly softer jawline.
