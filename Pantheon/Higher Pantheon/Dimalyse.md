*Daughter of Magic, Goddess of Curiosity, Sorcery Manifest*
Before crossing through the celestial barrier, Dimalyse was mocked and shrugged as one of the weaker deities. She was the goddess of curiosity and inquiries. She didn't have the answers like Auminoor did, her domain was to seek those answers. She was unknowing, and admitted to it. That sentiment made several gods mock her very being and existence.

When Dimalyse sacrificed her radiance and crossed through the celestial barrier, she almost didn't survive. Nearly all of her radiance cracked and shattered, sprinkling all across Ashendel. This was a spectacle to behold however, as once her radiance touched the [[Weave]], it expanded in a grandiose spectacle of colors, and energy. Not even the god of insight understood the phenomenon that stood before them. The weave expanded and the threads that wrapped around the world had become a part of her radiance. This radiance that could now be used by the creatures of Aurivale, it was Magic.

Dimalyse was now Sorcery Manifest, but the greatest part was she had no idea how far this magic or sorcery could go. The goddess of curiosity now had a entire new field of study to learn, practice, and understand with the mortals. While she may have few devoted followers, that few represent her undying curiosity and the thrill of pursuing the unknown. 


### Depiction
Dimalyse is depicted as a shadowy woman with dark piercing blue eyes, and angular and sharp features. Wearing what appears to be archmage ropes of white and blue motifs and filigrees. Some depictions show several piercing blue eyes orbiting her visage.
