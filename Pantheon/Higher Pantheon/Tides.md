*Fortune's Favor, Whims of Fate, God of Fate*
Tides is the very aspect of Destiny and Fate. While there are many actions that influence our future and fate, there will still always be a destined path we must all travel. Being the natural foil of [[Phiore]], Tides understands that there are some forces beyond our control. Tides does not stifle choice, but rather encourages acceptance of what must be, for we are never truly lost; the threads of destiny will always guide us.

Followers of Tides are taught to seek balance between choice and fate, understanding that there is a time and place for fighting, and a time for yielding. It is only when we resist against the flow of destiny, is when we suffer the greatest. Fate is only a subtle notion, our choices still impact our future and bring consequences, but they must live in harmony with our greater design and purpose.

### Depiction
Tides is often depicted as an older man drifting along the waves of an ocean. Some depict the ocean battling a raging storm, and yet the expression and safety of Tides remains the same.
