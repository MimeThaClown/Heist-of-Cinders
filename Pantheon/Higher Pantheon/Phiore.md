*Lady Luck, Drums of Liberation, Goddess of Freedom*
When Phiore crossed the celestial barrier, she found new freedom to do exactly whatever she wanted to do. Phiore represents luck, freedom, and liberation. Her domain represents the freedom of journey and finding one's own path. She despises concepts like fate or destiny, and prefers the notion of carving your own future. She is the natural foil of [[Tides]]. Her nature brought many to admire her free-spirit, often saving those under the control of oppressive forces. Bringer of luck and fortune, Phiore often interferes in the dealings of mortals, swaying their journey to match their ambitions.

Phiore has very few places of worship, symbolising her motif of journey and travel. Followers of Phiore share her devotion loosely, as she does not favor worship, but rather the message of freedom.

### Depiction
Phiore is depicted as a young woman with motifs of wind and travel embellished in her hair and adornments.
