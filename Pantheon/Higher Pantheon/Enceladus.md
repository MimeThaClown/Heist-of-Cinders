*Sovreign of Souls, The Grieved One, God of Death*
When Enceladus passed through the celestial barrier, he had by far suffered the most repercussions. When crossing through, the [[Malkandra|Mother of Decay]] struck him, causing him to lose most of his form and his radiance shattered. Enceladus was believed to be lost by the celestial barrier, all entirety of his radiance gone. It was only till after the gods grieved for him did his spectral form appear. Alive, but without the form or power to reside in [[Aeterna-Vincula]] like his peers. His radiance, corrupted by decay had casted over all life, granting all mortals-alike the curse of death. The damage the Decay Mother had caused was permanent. [[Paracelsus]] demanded that Malkandra takes responsibility for her betrayal or face the same forced exilement. With a smile, Malkandra gifted Enceladus [[Roque]], a demi-god of her creation to accompany Enceladus into the unknown. 

With Roque as his consort, Enceladus created the Afterlife. [[Hel (Afterlife)|Hel]], where the souls of the dead can rest for eternity. Even though his exile from Aeterna-Vincula was involuntary, Enceladus took up the role of Soul Warden with grace. His newfound purpose granted him peace and responsibility that he had lacked before the [[Age of Concord]]. His followers are thin, as many mortals fear the uncertainty of death and the afterlife. Still, Enceladus is never lonely, for his consort is always by his side, granting him solace and advice.


### Depiction
Enceladus has no true form or appearance. Still, many depict him as a pale and somewhat-slender man adorning a obsidian shaded-toga, with a gold laurel wrapped around his medium black hair. Emerald green eyes pierce all those that dare to make eye contact.

### Commandments of Enceladus
+ **All Souls Eventually Come to Rest**: *When the time is right, guide all lost souls to the gates of Hel.*
+ **No Being is Above Death**: *Never cheat death, for what would be the purpose of life if it did not come to end?*
+ **Punish Those who Hasten Death**: *Every soul must ripen before they greet Hel. Do not let unpurposed murder go unpunished.*
