*God of Strength, The Tempest, The Flying Banner*
Before the gods entered [[Aeterna-Vincula]], simple concepts like family were often lost. That being said, Edros is the closest thing the [[Paracelsus|Sun Father]] has to being a brother. While he had balanced qualities like patience, wisdom, and power, Edros valued strength above all else. His motif of power and storms brought strength to all who hailed his banners across the battlefield. His followers share his passion and spirit for unrivaled power. This strength does not come from malice nor heroism, but rather the glory that comes from unmatched power.


### Depiction
Edros is seen as a large and burly man, wrapped in the furs of legendary beasts that he had slain. Thunder clouds and lightning exalt their radiance behind him, granting his strikes the fury of storms.

### Commandments of Edros
+ **Die with Honor and Glory**: *There is no greater honor than dying on the battlefield.*
+ **Never Show Weakness**: *Courage has no room for needless complaining and weakness. To show your back to the enemy is the greatest dishonor.*
+ **Duty-bound Strength goes Unparalleled**: *Vowing your strength for duty or oath brings unwavering power.*
