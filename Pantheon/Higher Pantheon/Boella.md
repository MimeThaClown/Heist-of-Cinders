 *Weaver of Seasons, Nature's Voice, Goddess of The Wild*
Boella brought the seasons and the balance of nature to Aurivale. Whether born from distaste or shyness, Boella is incredibly reserved when interacting with mortals. Boella holds domain over all aspects of nature. Waterfalls, forests, lakes, and even deserts. Many druids, hunters, and nomads worship Boella, seeking her grace to live in harmony with the lands far from civilization and still bear her wild fangs.

Boella and her followers work together to preserve the balance of nature. Every creature has a place in nature, and whenever the balance is broken, Boella shows her rare tempered side. Natural disasters of  all kinds are within Boella's power, and she's not afraid to use them to keep the balance she cherishes.


### Depiction 
Popular depictions of Boella show a full-figured eladrin woman, sleeping beside an oak tree. Moss, vines, and other othergrowth have wrapped around her, and her hair is tangled in leaves and wreaths.

### Commandments of Boella
