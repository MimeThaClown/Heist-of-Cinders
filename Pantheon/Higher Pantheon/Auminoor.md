*Scribe of the Mind, The Light of Wisdom, God of Insight*

Auminoor, the god of wisdom and insight, is the unseen guide of those who seek true understanding. Though it was Paracelsus who first breached the celestial barrier, it was Auminoorâ€™s divine vision that allowed the Sun Father to glimpse beyond the veil. Above all virtues, Auminoor values wisdom, watching over mortals with the patience and care of a father tending to his children. His followers devote themselves to the quiet spread of knowledge and philosophy, shunning recognition, for prestige and fame stand in direct opposition to their sacred purpose.


### **Depiction**
Most representations of Auminoor displays a middle-aged man with a proud smile stretching across his wrinkling face, swathed in modest robes, and carrying a single scroll in his right hand.

### **Commandments of Auminoor**

* **Seek Wisdom without Pride**: *Knowledge is a blessing, not a tool for vanity. Let wisdom guide your path, but never feed your hubris.*
* **Teach the Importance of Reason:** *Truth can only be seen with a clear mind. Embracing emotions is to be mortal, but do not let it overcome you.
* **Knowledge Gives Power**: *Knowledge above all else can lead you down the path of certainty and truth*
