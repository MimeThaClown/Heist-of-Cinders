## Pantheon of Ashendel
The deities of Ashendel once resided in a realm beyond form and existence. Perhaps they weren't even "born" until the great transgression that began the [[Age of Concord]]. When Paracelsus committed the transgression of crossing the celestial barrier, and bestowed the [[Beloved Flame|Warmth of Creation]]. This act of divine defiance shocked the gods, for the cost of crossing the celestial barrier requires casting aside some of their radiance. Yet, drawn by the Sun Father's influence, some gods followed his path, surrendering a part of their power to join him in the newly-formed divine realm of [[Aeterna-Vincula]], a place forged by the Sun Father's resolve. 

Throughout this concord, many gods have found purpose in interacting with the mortals. Obtaining their own respective followers and faithful, their influence has changed the world for better and worse. While the gods' motives may be beyond the comprehension of mortals, many seek their divine favor and radiance. During present times, gods come in many shapes and forms, and some perhaps have yet to be birthed. Due to this, scribes have categorized the gods into a higher and lower pantheon. The higher pantheon mostly contains the gods that commited the great transgression and passed through the celestial barrier. The lower pantheon is more complex and is populated by both gods and near-divine beingsâ€”such as offspring of gods or mortals who have obtained radiance through immense power. 

Below is a list of the known gods alongside their respective domains and alignments.
