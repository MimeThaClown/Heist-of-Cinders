### Race: Half Elf

# Description
Soft spoken half elf. A gifted black smith and an architect. Though he doesn't carry a sword there is a quiet strength in him that makes people feel safe (Mainly Amara hehe). He runs a modest little forge nestled in the Escanor district. The sign above the door, aged by the weather and soot, read: “Fortune Favors the Bold”. He is a half-elf man who is Amara Silverthorn's childhood friend. He tends to be nervous and has good hospitality (he served Amara's friends pastries)
