## Ashendel
Welcome to Ashendel, a world once betrayed by unchallenged frost that wrapped all of the lands in it's icy embrace. The fate of Ashendel would remain this way until the dawning of the [[Age of Concord]] which Paracelsus gifted the Beloved Flame to Ashendel and created life. As the flame bursted with strength, the tundras slowly melted, leaving behind a small mass of land, too small to be called a continent formed from the melted frost. These lands would be known as Aurivale. The land of gold.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Aurivale: The Land of Gold
Aurivale was once a small patch of land that was nothing more than a speck on the frozen world. That was until the first [[Fire Keepers]] were born, using their gift from the Sun Father to produce their own [[Eternal Flame|Eternal Flames]], fighting against the frost to increase Aurivale's size. Yet, even as warmth spread across the land, the forever winters beyond the habitable world remained untouched, home to the monstrous and merciless dragons. These primordial beings, acclimated to the ruthless frost, view the encroachment of fire as a hubris brought by the mortals. As the Tribunal seeks to maintain balance and order, the dragons gather in the frozen wastes, their wrath an ever-looming shadow over Aurivale, threatening to reclaim the world in ice and ruin. And yet, even with the constant dangers surrounding the lands, we find flourishing kingdoms, and a unwavering resolve for the people of Aurivale to strive. Diverse cultures, grandiose rulers, and ambitious adventurers carve their destinies—big or small—striving to shape the future. Some seek power, others seek knowledge, and many simply fight to survive in a world where dragons still reign.

Aurivale encompasses two great nations who view the world in ways influenced by their cultures and the lands they call home. These two nations are:

Fairchronia: While still a small budding nation, Fairchronia was formed when Queen Drakon demanded independance from Sumeria. Now, a bustling nation of trade and commerce, Fairchronia has set aside their differences with Sumeria and developed several trade routes between the two nations. Fairchronia is the first nation to have access to the sea, as the semi-recently founded Pendragon is Aurivale's first port town.

Sumeria: Being the larger nation, Sumeria holds the entire central-northern region of Aurivale. The nation boasts a diverse system of climates and biomes, but the capitol resides in eastern deserts. Over the coming years, the Sumeria has seen several revolutionary scientific advancements in both their agriculture and military technology. Under the leadership of Sevro au Telimanus, a brilliant alchemist, the Sumarian Empire stands as a powerful kingdom. King Telimanus ascended to the throne after the death of his late brother-in-law. His expertise in science will shape Sumeria into a new era of innovation and prosperity.

## Magic
When life first began in Aurivale, a seperate thread of energy was born. An unseen force that flowed through Ashendel like an intricate web, weaving countless unseen strands across the land, intertwining itself with the very essence of the world. Not quite living, but not dead either. This enigmatic force wove itself into the fabric of the world, giving rise to what would come to be known as the [[Weave]], or better known as **Magic**.

Magic manifests in many shapes and forms, and even mortals can harness its power through spellcasting. There are two primary methods of spellcasting: **Component Casting** and the much rarer **Source Casting**.

### Component Versus Source Casting

[[Component Casting]] relies on external materials to interact with the **Weave**, such as an [[Igniter]] or various consumable ingredients that fuel the spell.

[[Source Casting]], on the other hand, draws directly from the caster’s own innate magic, allowing most spells to be cast without external components. However, this method has its limitations. Certain spells, like **Revivify**, still require specific materials—such as a gemstone—which are consumed upon casting.

### Designing a Spellcaster
In the present day (276 PC.), magic is widely regarded as a symbol of wealth, regardless of the casting method. **Source Casting** is seen as a divine blessing from **Dimalyse** herself, often elevating its practitioners to nobility. Meanwhile, **Component Casting** remains a costly endeavor, accessible only to those with the means to afford its expensive materials.

When creating your character, consider their casting style and the societal or financial challenges that come with it. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Celestial Bodies
Aurivale is blessed by a large golden sun and two moons. The two moons Llenna and Rhys share the same celestial rhythm, sharing the same intertwined orbit and moon cycles. They only differentiate in appearance—Llenna gleams a luminous silvery, while Rhys glows with a deeper shadowed blue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Pantheon
The deities of Ashendel once resided in a realm beyond form and existence. Perhaps they weren't even "born" until the great transgression that began the [[Age of Concord]]. When Paracelsus committed the transgression of crossing the celestial barrier, and bestowed the [[Beloved Flame|Warmth of Creation]]. This act of divine defiance shocked the gods, for the cost of crossing the celestial barrier requires casting aside some of their radiance. Yet, drawn by the Sun Father's influence, some gods followed his path, surrendering a part of their power to join him in the newly-formed divine realm of [[Aeterna-Vincula]], a place forged by the Sun Father's resolve. 

Throughout this concord, many gods have found purpose in interacting with the mortals. Obtaining their own respective followers and faithful, their influence has changed the world for better and worse. While the gods' motives may be beyond the comprehension of mortals, many seek their divine favor and radiance. During present times, gods come in many shapes and forms, and some perhaps have yet to be birthed. Due to this, scribes have categorized the gods into a higher and lower pantheon. The higher pantheon mostly contains the gods that commited the great transgression and passed through the celestial barrier. The lower pantheon is more complex and is populated by both gods and near-divine beings—such as offspring of gods or mortals who have obtained radiance through immense power.
