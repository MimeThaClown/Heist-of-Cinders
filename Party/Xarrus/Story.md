Xarrus' first met the original group ([[Haliya]],[[Godfrey]],[[player-vault/Party/Ryme/Relationships|Ryme]]) in the Roundtable tavern, where a bar fight broke out over a nerdy looking boy. Xarrus and the group ended up taking out the group (Xarrus killed a man and the body fell down the well). After the fight, the boy that they protected, spoke to the party, and revealed they needed their help finding someone who went missing. The 'boy' was very dodgy, so the group went and talked to them in a more private location (some back alley). This was where the boy revealed that he was- One: not a boy, and two: not a human, but a fairy-like familiar named, Dana. The group was hired to find a boy named Emmrich.

Xarrus, stayed behind and interrogated Dana (wasn't really an interrogation, Xarrus asked one question and rejoined the group). That is when the group travelled to the Red District (this is where the lead to find Emmrich led them), they were first stopped by the tribunal who had sanctioned off a crime scene, leading them to take a back alley through a shop called Merlins, a very purple shop.

When they got past the back alley, the group came across three buildings, Xarrus went into the abandoned tavern and found some gold. When he left that building he was met with Ryme and a child, named Bella. Some talking happened between the child, Godfrey, Ryme, and Xarrus- eventually it led with Xarrus entering the abandoned warehouse first and getting absolutely ambush.

The fight was surprisingly difficult, having dropped both Xarrus and Haliya, but they survived. This is where the group met a strange woman, named Amaryliss, we were all very suspicious of her but she kind of won us over. After deciding to rest for a few moments after the fight, we learned Calisto had something to do with Emmrich's dissapeareance (a kenku told us), and that the syndicate also had a part.

Before the party could deliberate any more, Calisto himself, showed up with a party of tribunal soldiers. This is where the group learned Calisto was looking for Emmrich as well, along with the news that the council had been attacked by the syndicate. 

(Arranis showed up too, but later and for like 40 seconds)

Once we rested up a little, we decided to continue on our way. On our way back, we ran into a woman knight actively threatening Calisto, her name was [[Amara]]- we obviously had to recruit her.  The party and her eventually agreed to team up, but very hesitantly.

What we didn't know, was that when Ryme dissapeared during the abandoned warehouse scene, he found some kind of riddle which we were able to decide enough to know that we had to go to the sewers (much to Rymes woe). On our way there, Amara caught eye of someone looking for her, and she did not want to be found by this man, so we hid in the shop of one her 'friends', [[Theo Cinders]], we totally weren't going to rob him.

Things were going well, until Arranis showed up at Theo's door, and Theo caved like a little bitch letting him inside the shop while Amra hid. No amount of stalling, stopped Arannis from
