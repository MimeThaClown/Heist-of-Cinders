Xarrus' first met the original group ([[Haliya]],[[Godfrey]],[[player-vault/Party/Ryme/Relationships|Ryme]]) in the Roundtable tavern, where a bar fight broke out over a nerdy looking boy. Xarrus and the group ended up taking out the group (Xarrus killed a man and the body fell down the well). After the fight, the boy that they protected, spoke to the party, and revealed they needed their help finding someone who went missing. The 'boy' was very dodgy, so the group went and talked to them in a more private location (some back alley). This was where the boy revealed that he was- One: not a boy, and two: not a human, but a fairy-like familiar named, Dana. The group was hired to find a boy named Emmrich.

Xarrus, stayed behind and interrogated Dana (wasn't really an interrogation, Xarrus asked one question and rejoined the group). That is when the group travelled to the Red District (this is where the lead to find Emmrich led them), they were first stopped by the tribunal who had sanctioned off a crime scene, leading them to take a back alley through a shop called Merlins, a very purple shop.
