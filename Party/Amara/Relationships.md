## Theodore Cinders - Childhood Friend

  - Amara often found herself wandering into Fortune’s Bold where Theodore Cinders runs a modest little forge nestled in the Escanor district. The sign above the door, aged by the weather and soot, read: “Fortune Favors the Bold”
  - She asked him and his father, Gilgamish Cinders to craft silver accessories for her upcoming party.
  - She invited him to the Lumière Ball, fully aware that both her mother-in-law, Cora Camille, and her fiancé would be in attendance.
  - While they practiced dancing together, she noticed he was acting strangely. It made her wonder if he was uncomfortable or perhaps reluctant to attend.
  - Lately, he seems to be hiding something from her, and it's unsettling. She's not used to secrets in their relationship; honesty had always been their norm.
  -  When her friends discovered she was engaged especially after meeting her  mother in law they were genuinely shocked. Most of them had assumed she and Theo were romantically involved. She dismissed the idea quickly, almost too quickly, reminding herself that Theo only saw her as his best friend. Still, their reactions stuck with her. It made her question things she thought she’d buried. But then she reminded herself of who she was and who he was. She was a knight, raised in discipline and to fight. Someone who never made it easy to be loved. Theo had seen too much: the rage in her, the temper she struggled to control, the sharp edges she rarely softened. A woman like her wasn’t the kind men like Theo would fall in love with. He deserved ease, gentleness not the weight of someone constantly at war with herself. "He doesn't deserve complicated," she thought. And yet, during the slow dance, something cracked. His hand on her waist, the way he looked at her when she nervously rambled it all felt too still, too close, too intimate to be nothing. “It’s just a dance,” she told herself, firm as steel. But gods, the way he was looking at her made her wonder… what if?
  - Amara's Mother in law tried to pay him 3000 gp to get him to stay away form Amara which he didn't accept. "What he have Amara its priceless to me no gold could ever replace what we have". She didn't expect Cora to go that far. To treat her and Theo like a transaction. She did know she was a bitch and stuck up but that was a new low. She felt cheap, like her relationships and friendships could be bought with coin. She felt mad at the implication that she was a burden. That being around him felt heavy. But then his words... He didn't hesitate. The could've taken the money. He could've walked away but he did not. She always believed she was too much for Theo. Too difficult, guarded, and angry. But just this once she accepted that maybe she wasn't. Maybe someone saw her scars and still stayed. And it scared her.

## Gilgamish Cinders - Theo's father

- Theo's father.
- Amara is very fond of him and the feeling is reciprocated. He loves to travel. He was giving Nevalon some blueprints to help build a city in a cave.
- He adopted a little girl Ari while he was travelling. Amara was excited to meet her but she was nowhere to be found when she was visiting to get the ignitor she needed to perform her ritual with Callisto.
- He seems to be very strong. Above average. And loves wrestling with Theo. While Theo also seems to be strong but not as strong as his father. She found is funny whenever they'd wrestle. The way Theo would immediately tap out. It made Amara laugh every time.

## Arannis Silverthorn - Older brother (deceased?)

  - Arannis served as the captain of an elite guard unit tasked with safeguarding pendragon. It earned him the respect and admiration across the city. He's revered for bravery and inspirational leadership. He upheld the Silverthorn family's prestigious reputation. So much so that a public funeral was held by the tribunal in the Escanor district in front of the tribuanal church. Banners of the surrounding buildings baring the sun sigil of Paracelsus  and also embroidered with it is the silverthorn household sigil. Noble families, common citizens, merchants, just about anyone gather to pay their respects.
  - Though he was busy with Tribunal duties. He would often run to Amara whenever he had a chance.
  - Arranis hated her mother in law. He was against the engagement and felt like the feeling was mutual.
  - She never let herself believe he was truly gone. There were too many things left unsaid, too many regrets. She had a glint of hope that he'd still be alive. She made a promise to herself that she'd exhaust every path till she knew for sure he was dead. She asked Father Callisto for help and he agreed to help. He asked her for a list of equipment he'd need for a ritual:

- 100 GP GEM (she acquired it from the jewelers shop her mother in law was in)
- Igniter GEM (From Fortunes Bold)
- Fist sized chunk of mithril (tbd)
  
  ## Cora Chamille - Mother in law
- She doesn't seem to respect Amara's brother very much.
- She cares a lot about keeping appearances.
- She was rude and out of line to her friend Haliya. She felt her blood was boiling up when she heard her words and even more when Haliya chose to leave her shop and yielded. Amara left after acquiring the gem she needed for the ritual and reassured Haliya that no matter what her occupation is she's is Amara Silverthorn's friend and she should never feel bad about herself when she's around.
- Her and her brother never liked her nor do they agree with this marriage.

## Lady Alariel Silverthorn - Mother
 -  She is a trusted council woman of the esteemed Ferror Council to Pendragon.
  
  
## Eldrin Silverthorn - Father 
## Leena Silverthorn - Sister

## Father Callisto
- Has a subtle protectiveness over Amara. 
- Once warned her: “Miss Silverthorn, I cannot recommend the path you're going down. There are things worse than death.”
- Is helping her with a ritual to find out if Arranis is alive or dead.
- She always hated him and blamed him for Arranis's death. Up until she found out Callisto that was in the sewers was a doppelganger. She felt guilty but prideful. But she had to swallow her pride to ask for a favor. “Take this with a collected head. You might lose more than what you’ve already lost.” What he said surprised her.
- She never expected to rely on someone like him. 


## Emeric Archambeau

- She's been protecting him for the past 6 years. But he ran away when she wasn't there and it took her weeks to find him with the help of her new companions and her brother Arranis. He was abducted by a Callisto doppelganger, a mind flayer, and a strange looking elf in the sewers.
- He was always fond of Bella. Everyone knows they have feelings but them. Amara ruined his secret and he wanted to ask her to go to the ball.
- To Amara he was more than a burden or responsibility. She started seeing him as more than a mission.
- He reminded her of innocence...Of the life she never got to have.
- She remembers the little things he enjoyed and would make him smile. Notices when he's scared even if he doesn't say a word.

## Ryme Valentine
- They met when she was looking for Emeric Archambeau.
- He doesn't seem to know how to tell the truth. Amara feels the need to question everything he's. Is he withholding information?

## Haliya
- They met when she was looking for Emeric Archambeau.
- They had a brief thoughtful conversation and Amara appreciated it. Doesn't know if the feelings were mutual but Amara's way of caring is a bit aggressive but she'd protect her no matter what. Because that was a gesture she received so little in her life. 
- Amara doesn't care what her occupation is. She's starting to be loyal to her.
- She laced Godfrey's drink. It seemed to Amara like she did not have a choice but to do it. There was no pride in it but still...it did not sit right. Amara felt like she couldn't be mad because deep down she would've done the same in a heart beat if her loves ones were in danger. But still, she hated the dishonor of it. The manipulation. All she could find herself doing was to hug her while she cried. She didn't have the right words. She rarely did in moments like these. Her strength had always been her sword. So she just held her. Even if she was falling apart too.

## Godfrey Thunderfall
- Poster boy of the Tribunal
- Seems to want to be friends with Amara and everyone.
- She's grateful that he knocked some sense into her when she was in that alleyway.
- Godfrey was hurt and angry about Haliya lacing his drink. Not just because of what was done but because he hadn't given a choice. If she'd asked he would've done it without hesitation. 

## Xarrus
- Has a deep fascination for monsters.
- A doppelganger was after their silver chain.
- Loves sweets and pastries.
