- ## Theodore Cinders - Childhood Friend
  


=="Amara often found herself wandering into Fortune’s Bold where Theodore Cinders runs a modest little forge nestled in the Escanor district. The sign above the door, aged by the weather and soot, read:== 

==“Fortune Favors the Bold”

  ==Arannis served as the captain of an elite guard unit tasked with safeguarding pendragon. It earned him the respect and admiration across the city. He's revered for bravery and inspirational leadership. He upheld the Silverthorn family's prestigious reputation. == == So much so that a public funeral was held by the tribunal in the Escanor district in front of the tribuanal church. Banners of the surrounding buildings baring the sun sigil of Paracelsus  and also embroidered with it is the silverthorn household sigil. Noble families, common citizens, merchants, just about anyone gather to pay their respects.
  
  ==Where father Calisto spoke:==
  
  =="We are here to honor Arannis Silverthorn knight of the tribunal who's noble heart and unshakable faith led him to make the ultimate sacrifice for his people. He was a flame in the darkness burning with pride and devotion to Paracelsus' will and more importantly the will of his family. Never did Arannis ever hide behind his title. But, he did give his everything in the oath that he'd sworn: to protect all people of Aurivale. Arannis and his final moments faced the greatest of tests, he threw himself into the fire of battle without hesitation not for glory but for the protection of his kin. In that moment his strength was not in his blade; but in his sacrifice. He gave his life so that another might live. So that Pendragon might live."==
  
 ==and led a prayer.==
  
==He continues... "By request of Lady Alariel Silverthorn, I have been entrusted with the final words of her son. But normally I would speak those final words. But, at the request of his sister she would like to speak for the templar of Pendragon, defender of the realm. (Idk what else he said) Amara would you like to step up?"==

==Amara steps up... and publicly read Arannis' will== 

=="If you are reading this, then I have fallen.  Not in shame, but in service. I ask that you do not weep for me. I chose this path, as surely as a blade is chosen for the hand.==

==If you would allow me, I have a few words for my family. Who were always my strength and the sharpness of my blade.==

==To my mother, Lady Alariel Silverthorn—you are the fire from which I was forged. It is your strength I carried into every battle, and your wisdom I held in every council. If I have ever made you proud, know that it is only a reflection of what you have instilled in me. My honor is yours.==

==To my father, Eldrin Silverthorn—I have often walked your shadow and hoped one day to be worthy of your name. If I did not say it enough: I respect you, more than you know. I hope now, in my absence, that you may speak more gently to Amara.==

==To Leena, my quiet star—you were always the one who understood the silence in me. Keep to your books, to your thoughts, to your way of seeing the world. Our house will need your clarity in the days to come. And if you cry, let it be only once—and then hold your head high. You’re a Silverthorn.==

==And lastly—to Amara, my little light. You always burned brightest. Too bright for this world, perhaps. I worried for you not because you were weak, but because the world does not know how to hold something like you without trying to snuff it out. Keep your blade close, but your heart closer. You are not alone, and you never have been.==

==If I had one more breath, I would use it to tell you this Amara: You are enough. You always were. Let no Tribunal, no title, no curse or doubt ever take that from you.==

==There is nothing left I desire, save for this: Let my armor rest in the halls of the Tribunal. Let my memory rest with my sisters. And let my sword remain where it always has been, in service of Amara. Let my name be not mourned, but remembered—as a brother, a son, and a knight who chose to stand.==

==May the flame be with you.==
==— Arannis Silverthorn"==
