Notable things:
- Amara made the choice to stay out of a dangerous conversation. She was told that whatever was being said inside the Fortune's Bold would put everyone she knew in danger. So she waited outside with Theo. She told herself she would give everything...Her very will to fight for Pendragon. To follow through with her dreams no matter what the cost. But then she thought of her parents, of him, and everyone she ever held dear...all tangled in something she couldn't' control made her realize that she had more to lose than she ever let herself to admit.
- Amara felt like everything was slipping out of her control. She stayed outside Fortune’s Bold because she didn’t want to hear something that could put the people she loved in danger. She tried to keep things calm with Haliya and even joked around to make her laugh. But when she realized the person she had been talking to wasn’t really Haliya, her heart sank. She was scared not for herself, but for Theo, for her family, and for everyone involved. She acted fast, drawing her sword and demanding answers. When she found the real Haliya, she felt a mix of relief and guilt. Later, when she argued with Theo, it hurt. She wanted to protect him, but he made her realize that she couldn’t keep holding herself back. His words stayed with her. Even though she agreed to help her friends again, she shut down emotionally. She said she was “fine,” but her angry face and crossed arms said she wasn’t.
- The argument with Theo hit her harder than she expected. She was trying to keep him safe, trying not to lose someone else after Arranis but Theo didn’t want that. He told her that if she was staying out of the fight just for him, it hurt him. He didn’t want to be the reason her friends couldn’t count on her. Amara tried to explain that it wasn’t just him it was her parents, her sister, everyone she cared about. She felt stuck, like no matter what choice she made, someone she loved could get hurt. When Theo said he didn’t want protection, Amara pushed back. She said it _was_ her choice to protect him, even if he didn’t want it. It wasn’t about being weak or strong it was about how much he meant to her. But when he said Pendragon was his home and she couldn’t risk it for him, she realized how different their fears were. She didn’t want to argue, but the pain and fear she’d been holding in finally spilled out. After that, things went quiet between them. She didn’t know what to say.
