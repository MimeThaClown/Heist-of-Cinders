The youngest daughter of the noble Family the Silverthorns. A prestigious elven family known for birthing strong knights. At some point in her past she was entrusted with the care of Emeric Archambeau. This responsibility left emotional marks, protectiveness, and perhaps even love. She shares a deep complex history with Theo Cinders. A half elf and a childhood friend. The two clearly trust each other, even if they donâ€™t always say what they mean out loud. She carries herself like someone trying to hold a perfect mask over a cracked foundation.
